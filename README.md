# Rest-Webpage

This has been an experimental project for creating a website from scratch without using any framework. It's one of my first webpages. 

All images, contact and address aren't real and they are not owned by me. They are used for practice only.
If you fee like I violated any copyrights, please contact me so I will take down any pics or information. 

This page was used with no CSS frameworks as base. On this page, I make use of floating, margins,tables, forms and other basics styles.

I am planning to make a responsive design as well. Any suggestions in styling would be appreciated as well.
